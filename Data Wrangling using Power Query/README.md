# Power Query â€“ The Data Wrangling Tool

Power Query can be seen as a free ranging data wrangling tool. As a cowboy uses a lasso to round up cattle, you can use Power Query take the unruly data you have and convert it into a format that can be used for report building and data visualization.

Power Query is the data extraction and transforming feature inside of Excel. It is accessible through the Data tab at the top of the software ribbon.

Power Query set a link between a data sources and the current excel work book. The data source can be a wide range of data types. The data is then shaped and transformed using the Power Query interface.

The way Power Query works is that the transformation steps that are applied to the data are listed on the right-hand column as Applied Steps. You can add or delete steps as you manipulate the data towards the format that you will need. Do not be fooled by the simple Power Query interface. Under the graphical interface there is a scripting language call M that can be used to create very complex data shaping solutions.

Once you are happy with the data format, you must load the data to another location. You have a few options. You could just create a connection, you can load the data to a tab in the excel work book or you can load the data to the Data Model (Power Pivot).

Power query can be used as a standalone tool or it can be used in combination with Power Pivot.
